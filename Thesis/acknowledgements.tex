This thesis wouldn't have existed without my thesis advisor, Daniel Borrero. Thank you, Daniel, for suggesting an awesome thesis topic, for motivating me, for spending a ton of time correcting more terrible thesis drafts than any human should have to, for introducing me to dynamical systems theory, and for all the grad school help. Good luck with that Taylor-Couette system.\\

By definition, this thesis wouldn't have existed were I not a physics major, so I'd like to thank the department as a whole for being the greatest department at Reed. Thank you, Lucas, for being an extremely supportive academic advisor and for a  challenging junior year. Thank you, Joel, for introducing me to the world of scientific computation, for running physics softball, and for your help with this thesis. Thank you, Darrell, for reminding me why quantum mechanics is awesome. Thank you, Johnny, for all the help with the grad school process. Thanks also to the physics seniors -- I will be proud to say that I was once a part of this group. You guys have made my time here special. \\
