The upper and lower plates (white) extend infinitely in the plane, as does the fluid (blue) filling the gap between them. The upper and lower plates move with some constant velocity, and apply shear stresses to the fluid, resulting in fluid motion. While in general the plates can move in any direction, there is always a reference frame in which the plates move with equal but opposite velocity and it is convenient to work in this reference frame. According to convention, the $x$ axis is aligned along the plate velocity and is referred to as the {\bf  streamwise} direction. The $y$-axis is aligned perpendicular to the plates and is referred to as the {\bf  wall-normal} direction. The $z$-axis is normal to both axes and is referred to as the {\bf  spanwise} direction.}}{2}}

We begin by selecting a random initial state for the trajectory. This initial state can either be found by generating a truly random state, or by applying a small, random perturbation to known exact coherent structures. The desired symmetry constraints are then enforced, and the trajectory is integrated from $t = 0$ to $t=t'$. After every time step, if the state's norm has dropped below some threshold $R$ (I use 0.1), we assume that the trajectory has relaminarized, and find a new initial condition to work with. Once the integration is over, we generate the recurrence diagram according to (3.49\hbox {}), for some $T_{\textrm  {max}}$, and attempt to find any patterns that we would associate with exact coherent structures. If no patterns are found, we find another initial state and repeat the process. If there are some candidate patterns, we calculate the minimum $\mathfrak  {R}$ of that feature. If it is below about $10^{-4}$, we accept it as a potential solution, and pass it to the NKH solver. If $\mathfrak  {R}$ is not low enough, it is likely not a sufficiently good guess to cause the NKH solver to converge in a reasonable time, so we zoom in on the pattern and calculate a refined recurrence graph, until either the minimum value of the pattern is low enough, or it becomes apparent that the pattern is unlikely to produce a meaningful initial guess}}{39}}

As $r$ approaches 4, the original stable solution and the new unstable solution approach each other until at $r= 4$, they annihilate in another saddle node bifurcation, leaving only the new stable solution.

It does, however, suggest that P85 may have some importance in turbulent transition, since the trajectories only remain`bound' to a narrow area of D-I space while they are within the orbit of P85.}}{57}}
