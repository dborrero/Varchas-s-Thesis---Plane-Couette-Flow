% This is the Reed College LaTeX thesis template. Most of the work 
% for the document class was done by Sam Noble (SN), as well as this
% template. Later comments etc. by Ben Salzberg (BTS). Additional
% restructuring and APA support by Jess Youngberg (JY).
% Your comments and suggestions are more than welcome; please email
% them to cus@reed.edu
%
% See http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex.html for help. There are a 
% great bunch of help pages there, with notes on
% getting started, bibtex, etc. Go there and read it if you're not
% already familiar with LaTeX.
%
% Any line that starts with a percent symbol is a comment. 
% They won't show up in the document, and are useful for notes 
% to yourself and explaining commands. 
% Commenting also removes a line from the document; 
% very handy for troubleshooting problems. -BTS

% As far as I know, this follows the requirements laid out in 
% the 2002-2003 Senior Handbook. Ask a librarian to check the 
% document before binding. -SN

\begin{document}

  \maketitle
  \frontmatter % this stuff will be roman-numbered
  \pagestyle{empty} % this removes page numbers from the frontmatter

% Acknowledgements (Acceptable American spelling) are optional
% So are Acknowledgments (proper English spelling)
	\input{acknowledgements}

% The preface is optional
% To remove it, comment it out or delete it.
	\input{preface}

  \tableofcontents
% if you want a list of tables, optional
  \listoftables
% if you want a list of figures, also optional
  \listoffigures
		
% The abstract is not required if you're writing a creative thesis (but aren't they all?)
% If your abstract is longer than a page, there may be a formatting issue.
	\input{abstract}
	\input{dedication}

  \mainmatter % here the regular arabic numbering starts
  \pagestyle{fancyplain} % turns page numbering back on

% Double spacing: if you want to double space, or one and a half 
% space, uncomment one of the following lines. You can go back to 
% single spacing with the \singlespacing command.
% \onehalfspacing
% \doublespacing

	\input{introduction}
	
	\input{chapter1}

	\input{math}

	\input{tablesandgraphics}

	\input{conclusion}

%If you feel it necessary to include an appendix, it goes here.
	\appendix

	\input{AppendixA}
	\input{appendixB}


%This is where endnotes are supposed to go, if you have them.
%I have no idea how endnotes work with LaTeX.

  \backmatter % backmatter makes the index and bibliography appear properly in the t.o.c...

% if you're using bibtex, the next line forces every entry in the bibtex file to be included
% in your bibliography, regardless of whether or not you've cited it in the thesis.
  \nocite{*}

% Rename my bibliography to be called "Works Cited" and not "References" or ``Bibliography''
% \renewcommand{\bibname}{Works Cited}

%    \bibliographystyle{bsts/mla-good} % there are a variety of styles available; 
%  \bibliographystyle{plainnat}
% replace ``plainnat'' with the style of choice. You can refer to files in the bsts or APA 
% subfolder, e.g. 
 \bibliographystyle{APA/apa-good}  % or
 \bibliography{thesis}
 % Comment the above two lines and uncomment the next line to use biblatex-chicago.
 %\printbibliography[heading=bibintoc]

% Finally, an index would go here... but it is also optional.
\end{document}
