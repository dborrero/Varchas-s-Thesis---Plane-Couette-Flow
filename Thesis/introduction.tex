\epigraph{ I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven, there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids. And about the former, I am optimistic. }{Horace Lamb, 1932}
	
Although much work has been done in understanding turbulence since Lamb's time, the twin problems of understanding the nature of the transition to turbulence and predicting the fine structure of turbulent flows remain unsolved to this day, having vexed scientists and engineers in much the same way a plucky band of Gauls did for Caesar. Understanding turbulence is vitally important, since turbulent flows appear in man-made scenarios such as the flow around ships or aircraft, as well as in natural scenarios like the atmosphere of Jupiter and the flow of blood in the heart. The degree to which a flow is turbulent is characterized by its {\bf Reynolds number} \ReN, a dimensionless parameter that encodes the relative importance of inertial and viscous forces. At small \ReN, the {\bf viscosity} of a fluid (which is analogous to fluid friction) dominates, and smooths out velocity gradients in the flow, resulting in well-ordered, {\bf laminar} flow. At large \ReN, kinetic energy is dissipated at a lower rate, allowing for the existence of increasingly complex flow structures such as eddies or vortices (\refFig{fig:cylinderWake}). These structures, which are typical of {\bf turbulence}, display large spatiotemporal variations and structure at a variety of spatial and temporal scales.

\caption{A schematic of the plane Couette geometry. The upper and lower plates (white) extend infinitely in the plane, as does the fluid (blue) filling the gap between them. The upper and lower plates move with some constant velocity, and apply shear stresses to the fluid, resulting in fluid motion. While in general the plates can move in any direction, there is always a reference frame in which the plates move with equal but opposite velocity and it is convenient to work in this reference frame. According to convention, the $x$ axis is aligned along the plate velocity and is referred to as the {\bf streamwise} direction. The $y$-axis is aligned perpendicular to the plates and is referred to as the {\bf wall-normal} direction. The $z$-axis is normal to both axes and is referred to as the {\bf spanwise} direction.}\label{fig:planeCouette}

\section{Plane Couette Flow} 

Since viscosity is a dissipative force, a viscous fluid that has no energy input will eventually come to rest as its kinetic energy is dissipated into thermal energy. Therefore, sustaining turbulence requires continuous energy input. In the case of the flow between two infinite parallel plates (\refFig{fig:planeCouette}), which known as \pCf\ and is the focus of this thesis, this is provided byQQ the wall shear. The geometry of the plane Couette system is extremely simple, with a geometrical parameter $h$, the half-distance between the parallel plates, and a kinematic parameter $V$, the constant velocity of the upper plate. This gives the Reynolds number as 
\begin{equation}
\ReN = \frac{hV}{\nu},
\end{equation}
where $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. When \ReN~is very small, only the laminar flow state is stable. In the case of \pCf\ this corresponds to a linear velocity profile, shown in \refFig{fig:planeCouetteBulk}. As \ReN~increases, experiments\rf{Daviaud1992} have demonstrated the existence of long-lived turbulent flows, despite the fact that linear stability analysis predicts that the laminar state should remain stable.
\begin{figure}

\caption{A cross-sectional representation of \pCf, with the linear, laminar velocity profile shown. By symmetry, the laminar profile must be the same everywhere. At the top and bottom, where the fluid meets the walls, no-slip boundary conditions require that the wall-tangent velocity equal the boundary velocity.}\label{fig:planeCouetteBulk}
\end{figure}

\section{Tackling Turbulence} 

The traditional approach for the analysis of turbulent flow is the statistical approach initially developed by Reynolds, Prandtl, von Karman, Kolmogorov and others\rf{Pope2000}. At the core of the statistical approach to turbulence is the assumption that turbulent flow states can be expressed as random perturbations around some mean flow. At high \ReN, where direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the flow is computationally infeasible,\footnote{In essence, this is due to the fact that the minimum computational resolution required for DNS scales as $\ReN^{2.25}$ in 3D. As a result, the numerical resolution required to resolve even moderate \ReN flows is huge.}  the statistical approach is invaluable. However, at low-to-moderate \ReN, these models can become less accurate\rf{Pope2000}. Even ignoring the moderate \ReN\ behavior of the statistical models, a fundamental problem with the statistical approach is that it discards much of the dynamical information about turbulence. Some statistical methods like Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes choose to time-average the Navier-Stokes equations, while others like Large Eddy Simulations model all small length scale behavior, resolving only large length scales. For this reason, it seems likely that while statistical methods will remain fundamental to applied computational fluid dynamics (CFD), especially in engineering practice, they cannot truly provide an answer to the turbulence problem. \\

An alternate approach was proposed by Eberhard Hopf in 1948\rf{Hopf1948}. Hopf suggested that solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations might be thought of as trajectories in an infinite dimensional state space in which each point corresponded to a possible velocity field. To better understand what this would mean, consider the mean velocity field of some infinitesimal volume of fluid, pictured in \refFig{fig:VectorSpace}. In order to describe the velocity at a point in the fluid, three numbers are required (each of which can take any real value), so this vector lives in a three dimensional vector space. Now any finite fluid volume will have an infinite number of points at which the velocity field has to be specified, so we would need an infinite set of numbers to describe the full velocity field. An object that would keep track of all these numbers would form an infinite dimensional vector $\Vector{v} = \{v_{i,1},v_{i,2},v_{i,3}...\},~i \in \mathbb{R}$, so that any flow state would be represented by a unique vector in this infinite dimensional vector space, which is known as the {\bf state space}. 


\begin{figure}
\centerline{
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Figs/VectorSpace}}
\caption{At each point in the fluid volume, the velocity field has a value that is described by three numbers, thus requiring three dimensions to track over time.}\label{fig:VectorSpace}
\end{figure}


Luckily, every point in the space does not necessarily correspond to a solution of the Navier-Stokes equation; for a given finite \ReN, for instance, the gradient of the velocity field cannot be too large since it would be smoothed out by viscosity. Hopf thus conjectured that physical trajectories corresponding to solutions to the Navier-Stokes equation would lie on some finite-dimensional manifold (known as the {\bf inertial manifold}) embedded within this infinite dimensional space. The restriction of dynamics from the infinite dimensional space to a finite dimensional inertial manifold due to the variation of a control parameter\footnote{The control parameter of a dynamical system is a number that is time-independent, and typically dictates the behavior of the system in some way. For instance, in the dimensionless simple harmonic oscillator, $\ddot{x} + 2\zeta \dot{x} + x = 0$, the control parameter is the dimensionless number $\zeta$, whose value determines whether the system is undamped, underdamped, over damped or critically damped.} has been rigorously proven under certain conditions\rf{Foias1988}. For the Navier-Stokes equation, the inertial manifold's control parameter is \ReN, and physical intuition suggests that its structure should also have \ReN~dependence, since at very low \ReN, the only physical solution is the laminar state which corresponds to a point in the state space. As \ReN\ increases, more complex flows become physically permissible, so the inertial manifold grows from a point of dimension 0 into a more complex, higher dimensional manifold. Hopf proposed that turbulence in this view was simply a trajectory that would travel across wide distances on the inertial manifold. \\


\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[scale=0.5	]{Figs/LorenzAttractor}}
\caption{A plot of a trajectory for the Lorenz system. The Lorenz system is an excellent example of a system in which the dynamics collapse onto an inertial manifold - in this case, the dynamics exist on a manifold of fractal dimension 2.06\rf{Grassberger2004}, even though the state space is in three dimensions. }\label{fig:LorenzAttractor}
\end{figure}

Unfortunately for Hopf, the computer power necessary to pursue this line of work was not available in 1948, leading him to comment in frustration that ``“the great mathematical difficulties of these important problems are well
known and at present the way to a successful attack on them seems hopelessly
barred"\rf{Hopf1948}. It would take until 1963 and the derivation of the Lorenz system (\refFig{fig:LorenzAttractor}) for the first numerical state-space analysis of turbulence\rf{Lorenz1963}, albeit for a highly truncated version of Navier-Stokes, designed to investigate Rayleigh-Bernard convection.\footnote{Interestingly, Lorenz truncated Navier-Stoke via a Galerkin approximation, which is what the simulation library {\tt Channelflow} which features heavily in this thesis also does, though it allows for many more Fourier modes than Lorenz did.} There have also been a number of efforts to explore the structure of invariant manifolds in moderate \ReN\ turbulence Navier-Stokes, such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition\rf{Aubry1988} and the `self-sustaining process theory'\rf{Dauchot2000}, which while fruitful, are nevertheless models of turbulent flow, and not an exact analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations.\\


\begin{figure}[h]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figs/ECSClassification}}
\caption{The four main categories of \ecs. In all diagrams, only a particular flow structure is displayed, to demonstrate the various types of \ecs. These could be, for example, isosurfaces of velocity or energy. (a) An {equilibrium} solution, where the fluid structure does not change over time. (b) A {relative equilibrium} or {traveling wave} solution, where the state does not change in its own reference frame, but is translated relative to the observer. (c) A {periodic orbit}, where the flow state changes over time, but returns to the original state after some period $T$. (d) A {relative periodic orbit}, where the flow state is periodic in its own reference frame, but is translated relative to the observer.}\label{fig:ECS}
\end{figure}


Another avenue of research emerged in 1990, when Nagata computed nontrivial {\bf equilibrium} flow states for \pCf\ by continuing the wavy vortex solution of Taylor-Couette flow\rf{Nagata1990}. This class of solutions, which were named {\bf exact coherent structures} by Waleffe\rf{Waleffe2001} are the result of calculating exact, invariant solutions of the fully resolved Navier-Stokes equations. The family of \ecs\ was expanded with the discovery of {\bf traveling wave equilibria} by Nagata in 1997, the computation of {\bf periodic orbits} by Kawahara and Kida in 2001\rf{Kawahara2001}, and the computation of {\bf relative periodic orbits}\footnote{That is, flow states that are periodic after some phase shift} by Viswanath in 2007\rf{Viswanath2007}. \refFig{fig:ECS} summarizes these four categories of \ecs. The ultimate hope of this line of research is that turbulence can be viewed as chaotic trajectories on the inertial manifold that are guided by hyperbolic \ecs\footnote{That is to say, the \ecs\ have many stable directions that are highly attractive and pull trajectories towards them, and a few unstable directions that ultimately eject the trajectory.} (\refFig{fig:guidedTurbulence}). \\

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{A schematic of a turbulent trajectory in state space and the coherent structures that guide it. (a) A turbulent trajectory in black appears chaotic and unpredictable in isolation. (b) When the underlying coherent structures in red are superimposed, however, the guiding of the dynamics by the \ecs\ becomes evident. Starting from the left, the trajectory is pulled in towards an equilibrium (filled circle) along its stable manifold (arrow pointing inwards), before being ejected along its unstable manifold (arrow pointing outwards). The trajectory then shadows three periodic orbits, whose stable and unstable manifolds are not trivial to represent visually, but nonetheless exist, before being attracted and ejected by the final equilibrium and continuing on its way.

\caption{The roll-streak structure of the Nagata upper branch equilibrium\rf{Nagata1990}. The in-plane velocity vectors in the periodic cell are displayed for the box walls, as well as the mid-plane. The coloration reflects the streamwise velocity, where blue indicates a large streamwise velocity out of the page, and red represents a large streamwise velocity into the page. The vortex that forms the roll is clearly visible on the near box wall, as is the streak running through the midplane of the box. These structural features are often seen in real turbulent flows, and solutions that approach the vicinity of this solution in the state space will take on some of this roll-streak structure.}\label{fig:rollstreak}
\end{figure}


Of the work that has been done in the field, a large proportion of it has been computational, and experiments by Hof et al. and De Lozar et al.\rf{Hof2004,DeLozar2012} provide the only direct experimental verification of the existence of \ecs~in nature to date. However there have been several indirect results that establish the importance of \ecs\  in turbulent dynamics. These include the resemblance of Nagata's so-called `upper branch' equilibrium solution\rf{Nagata1990} to the roll-streak structure seen in DNS\rf{Gibson2008} (\refFig{fig:rollstreak}), and the potential role of the stable manifold of its sister lower branch solution in separating the turbulent and laminar basins of attraction\rf{Waleffe2001}. Advances in computing power, along with the development of CFD algorithms, such as {\tt Channelflow}\rf{Gibson2014}, have also made the computation of these structures generally feasible.\\

 In order to compute the first generation of \ecs, researchers placed substantial symmetry constraints on the dynamics. This had the benefit of greatly reducing the computational cost, but has resulted in \ecs\ that are not necessarily representative of turbulence, since we expect turbulent fields to display little to no symmetry in general. As a result, while the symmetric \ecs\ 	appear to inform our understanding of turbulent transitions\rf{Halcrow2008}, they do not necessarily inform our understanding of turbulent dynamics. The focus of this thesis has been to find periodic orbits with broken symmetry, and to investigate their properties and how they compare to their unbroken brethren.\\ 
 




In Chapter 1, I will lay out the Navier-Stokes equation and the Couette geometry  in further detail. In Chapter 2, I will discuss the symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations for plane Couette flow and the advantages and disadvantages afforded by considering symmetric subspaces. Chapter 3 will discuss in detail the spectral methods used to integrate Navier-Stokes forward in time and the Newton-Krylov-hookstep algorithm used to find \ecs\ in {\tt Channelflow}, along with the workflow used in this thesis. Chapter 4 will present the results of these calculations, which include a new low-period orbit with broken symmetry that exists over a wide range of Reynolds numbers and computational domain sizes. Finally, Chapter 5 will provide a summary of the main ideas and suggests potential topics for future research.
