\epigraph{ I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven, there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids. And about the former, I am optimistic}{Horace Lamb, 1932}
	
Although much work has been done in understanding turbulence since Lamb's time, the turbulence problem remains unsolved to this day. Flow states are said to be {\bf turbulent} if they display large spatiotemporal variations in fluid velocity, as in \refFig{fig:cylinderWake}. The problem itself can be stated simply -- Is there a way us to begin with an initial flow state and a geometry (say, the body of an airplane), and properly predict the behavior, properties and structure of the flow state forward in time, down to the smallest scales?  In this case it is deceptively simple, for much like a small, unnamed village in coastal Armorica holding out against the Romans, the turbulence problem that has confounded physicists and engineers for centuries. Understanding turbulence is vitally important, since turbulent flows appear in artificial scenarios such as the flow around ships or aircraft, and in natural scenarios from the atmosphere of Jupiter to the blood flow in the heart.  Turbulent flows are typically characterized by the {\bf Reynolds number}, which is the (dimensionless) ratio between the inertial and viscous damping forces. At small \ReN, viscosity dominates, and smooths out large velocity gradients in the fluid, resulting in the well-ordered {\bf laminar} flow. At large \ReN, kinetic energy is dissipated at a lower rate, allowing for the existence of increasingly complex flow structures, such as eddies or vortices, which are characteristic of turbulence.

\section{Transitions to and from Turbulence}

Understanding the transition to and from turbulence states are important for both theoretical and practical reasons. Laminar flows tend to cause less drag in aerodynamic scenarios, but fluid lamina do not mix fluids efficiently, and thus are much less effective in scenarios that require efficient mixing. Turbulent flows on the other hand tend to cause more drag in aerodynamic flows, tend to mix fluids extremely quickly. In general, there are two routes by which flows transition to turbulence. In the supercritical transition, an increase in \ReN~above some critical value results in the loss of stability of the laminar state\footnote{That is to say, it is no longer stable against infinitesimal perturbations} and the emergence of new stable solutions of higher complexity. These states eventually bifurcate into even more complex states at higher critical values, eventually resulting in turbulence. Supercritical transitions occur in Taylor-Couette flow with low outer-cylinder rotation rates, and well as in Rayleigh-Bernard convection, and are well predicted by linear stability analysis. \\

The second, more complex type of transition is the subcritical transition. In the subcritical transition, the laminar state loses stability at lower \ReN~than linear stability analysis would predict, and the flow transitions \emph{directly} to turbulence, instead of increasingly gradually in complexity. Furthermore, the laminar state remains locally stable - that is, some finite perturbation is needed to `kick' the flow into turbulence. Subcritical transitions cannot be predicted by linear stability analysis and are, therefore, less well understood. Nevertheless can be physically important. Subcritical transitions occur in pressure-driven flows in pipes, which models flows such as those in hypodermic needles or lung alveoli, or shear-driven flow between two infinite parallel plates (displayed in \refFig{fig:planeCouette}), which is known as \pCf, and is the focus of this thesis \rf{Eckhardt2008,Manneville2015}. Systems that transition subcritically also exhibit transient turbulence, where the moderate \ReN~ turbulent flows can suddenly relaminarize, often with no obvious indication\rf{Brosa1989}. There are also a vast array of studies showing that the probability that a flow remains turbulent decays exponentially, that is
\begin{equation}
P(\textrm{Turbulent}) \propto e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}},
\end{equation}
in both pipe and \pCf s\rf{Hof2008,Bottin1998}, where $\tau$ is the `half life' of turbulence. It is evident that $\tau$ has some \ReN~dependence, but the functional form is not well known, nor is it known if there is some critical \ReN~after which $\tau$ diverges and turbulence is sustained. 
\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Figs/planeCouetteDiagram}}
\caption{A diagram of the plane Couette geometry. The upper and lower plates extend infinitely in the plane, as does the fluid filling the gap. The upper and lower plates move with some constant velocity, and apply shear stresses on the fluid, resulting in fluid motion. While in general the plates can move in any direction, there is always a reference frame in which the plates move with equal but opposite velocity, and it is convenient to work in this reference frame. According to convention, the $x$ axis is aligned along the plate velocity, and is also referred to as the {\bf streamwise} direction, the $y$-axis is aligned perpendicular to the plates and is referred to as the {\bf wall-normal} direction, and the $z$-axis is normal to both axes and is referred to as the {\bf spanwise} direction.}\label{fig:planeCouette}
\end{figure}

\section{Plane Couette Flow} 

The geometry of the plane Couette system is extremely simple, with only one geometrical parameter $h$, the half-distance between the parallel plates, and one kinematic parameter $V$, the velocity of the upper plate\footnote{While in principle the upper and lower plate can have different velocities, there should always be a reference frame in which the upper plate has velocity $V$, and the lower plate has velocity $-V$.}, giving the Reynolds number as 
\begin{equation}
\ReN = \frac{hV}{\nu},
\end{equation}
where $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity. When \ReN~is very small, only the laminar flow state is stable. In the case of \pCf, this corresponds to the linear velocity profile shown in \refFig{fig:planeCouetteBulk}. As \ReN~increases, however, we would expect the emergence of long lived turbulence, which has been seen in experiments\rf{Daviaud1992}.
\begin{figure}

\caption{A cross-sectional representation of \pCf, with the laminar velocity profile shown. By symmetry, the laminar profile must be the same everywhere.}\label{fig:planeCouetteBulk}

\section{Tackling Turbulence} 

The traditional approach towards the analysis of turbulence for the last century has been the statistical approach initially developed by Reynolds, Prandtl, von Karman, Kolmogorov and others\rf{Pope2000}. At the core of the statistical approach to turbulence is the assumption that turbulent flow states can be expressed as random perturbations around some mean flow. At extremely high \ReN, where direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the flow is computationally infeasible, the statistical approach is invaluable, but at low-to-moderate \ReN, these models can become less accurate\rf{Pope2000}. Even ignoring the moderate \ReN behavior of the statistical models, the fundamental issue with the statistical approach is its discarding of the dynamical information about turbulence. Methods like Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes use a combination of time-averaging and modeling to eliminate small scale perturbations, while Large Eddy Simulations explicitly do not resolve small scale structures, and choose instead to model them. For this reason, it seems likely that while statistical methods are the foundation of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), they cannot truly provide an answer to the turbulence problem. \\

An alternate approach was proposed by Eberhard Hopf in 1948\rf{Hopf1948}. Hopf suggested that solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations might be thought of as trajectories in an infinite dimensional state space in which each point corresponded to a possible velocity field. To better understand what this would mean, consider the velocity field at a point in the fluid, pictured in \refFig{fig:VectorSpace}. In order to describe the velocity vector, three numbers are required (each of which can take any real value), so this microsystem has three dimensions. Now any finite fluid volume will have an uncountably infinite number of points at which the velocity field has a value, so we would need an uncountably infinite set of numbers to describe any velocity field. An object that would keep track of all these numbers would form an infinite dimensional vector, so that any flow state can be represented by a particular vector in this infinite dimensional vector space, known as the {\bf state space}. 
\begin{figure}
\centerline{
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Figs/VectorSpace}}
\caption{At each point in the fluid volume, the velocity field has a value that is described by three numbers, thus requiring three dimensions to track over time.}\label{fig:VectorSpace}
\end{figure}
Luckily, every point in the space does not necessarily correspond to a solution of the Navier-Stokes equation; for a given finite \ReN, for instance, the gradient of the velocity field cannot be too large. Hopf thus conjectured that physical trajectories, corresponding to solutions to the Navier-Stokes equation would lie on some finite-dimensional manifold (known as the {\bf inertial manifold}) embedded within this infinite dimensional space. The restriction of dynamics from the infinite dimensional space to a finite dimensional inertial manifold due to the variation of a control parameter has been rigorously proven under certain conditions\rf{Foias1988}. For the Navier-Stokes equation, the inertial manifold's control parameter is \ReN, and physical intuition suggests that its structure should also have \ReN~dependence, since at very low \ReN, the only physical solution is the laminar state, and as \ReN~increases, more complex flows become physically permissible. Hopf proposed finally that turbulence in this view was simply a trajectory that would travel across wide distances on the manifold. \\
\begin{figure}[h]
\centerline{
\includegraphics[scale=0.5	]{Figs/LorenzAttractor}}
\caption{A plot of a particular trajectory around the Lorenz attractor. The Lorenz system is an excellent example of a system in which the dynamics exist on a submanifold - in this case, the space is reduced from three dimensions to the (fractal) dimension of 2.06\rf{Grassberger2004}. }\label{fig:LorenzAttractor}
\end{figure}

Unfortunately for Hopf, the computer power necessary to pursue this line of work was not available in 1948, leading him to comment in frustration that ``“the great mathematical difficulties of these important problems are well
known and at present the way to a successful attack on them seems hopelessly
barred". It would take until 1963 and the derivation of the Lorenz attractor (\refFig{fig:LorenzAttractor}) for the first numerical state-space analysis of turbulence\rf{Lorenz1963}, albeit for a highly truncated version of Navier-Stokes, designed to investigate Rayleigh-Bernard convection\footnote{Interestingly, Lorenz truncated Navier-Stoke via a Galerkin approximation, which is what {\tt Channflow} also does, though it allows for many more Fourier modes than Lorenz did.}. There have also been a number of efforts to explore the structure of invariant manifolds in moderate turbulence Navier-Stokes, such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition\rf{Aubry1988} and the `self-sustaining process theory'\rf{Dauchot2000}, but while fruitful they are nevertheless models of turbulent flow, and not an exact analysis of Navier-Stokes. Another avenue of research emerged in 1990, when Nagata computed nontrivial {\bf equilibrium} flow states in plane Couette flow by continuing the wavy vortex solution of Taylor-Couette flow\rf{Nagata1990}. This class of solutions, which were named {\bf exact coherent structures} by Waleffe\rf{Waleffe2001} are the result of calculating exact, invariant solutions of the fully resolved Navier-Stokes equation. The family of \ecs~was expanded with the discovery of {\bf traveling wave equilibira} by Nagata in 1997, the computation of {\bf periodic orbits} by Kawahara and Kida in 2001\rf{Kawahara2001}, and the computation of {\bf relative periodic orbits}\footnote{That is, flow states that are periodic after some phase shift} by Viswanath in 2007\rf{Viswanath2007}. \refFig{fig:ECS} summarizes the four categories of \ecs. The ultimate hope of this line of research is that turbulence can be viewed as chaotic trajectories on the inertial manifold that are guided by \ecs~(\refFig{fig:guidedTurbulence}), implying that a fundamental understanding of \ecs~would lead to a better understanding of turbulent dynamics.  \\
\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figs/ECSClassification}}
\caption{The four main categories of \ecs. In all diagrams, only a particular velocity structure of the flow state is displayed, to demonstrate the particular type of \ecs.(a) An {equilibrium} solution, where the fluid structure does not change over time; b), a {relative equilibirum} or {travelling wave} solution, where the state does not change in its own reference frame, but is translated relative to the observer; c), a {periodic orbit}, where the flow state changes over time, but returns to the original state after some period $T$; d), a {relative periodic orbit}, where the flow state is periodic in its own reference frame, but is translated relative to the observer.}\label{fig:ECS}
\end{figure}


While there has been a great deal of progress in this field, much of it has been computational, though experiments by Hof and de Lozar\rf{Hof2008}  are at present the only direct experimental verifications for the existence of \ecs~in nature. However, indirect results, such as the resemblance of the upper branch solution to the roll-streak structure seen in DNS\rf{Gibson2008}, and the potential role of the stable manifold of the lower branch solution in separating the turbulent and laminar basins of attraction suggest that \ecs\ likely play a fundamental role in the behavior and evolution of turbulent flow states. Advances in computing power, along with the development of CFD algorithms such as Channelflow\rf{Gibson2014} have also made the computation of these structures generally feasible. In order to compute the original \ecs, substantial symmetry constraints were placed upon the dynamics. This had the benefit of greatly reduced computational complexity, but has resulted in \ecs\ that are not necessarily representative of turbulence, since we expect turbulent fields to display little to no symmetry in general. As a result, while the symmetric \ecs\ 	appear to inform our understanding of turbulent transitions, they do not necessarily inform our understanding of turbulent dynamics. The focus of this thesis has been to investigate the properties of periodic orbits with broken symmetry, and their relation to structures in symmetric spaces.

 In the first chapter, I will lay out in further detail the Navier-Stokes equation and problem geometry. In the second chapter, I will discuss the symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations for plane Couette flow, and the advantges and disadvantages afforded by considering symmetric subspaces. The third chapter will discuss in detail the spectral methods used to integrate Navier-Stokes forward in time and the Newton-Krylov-hookstep algorithm used to find coherent structures in Channelflow, along with the workflow used in this thesis. Chapter 4 presents the results of this thesis, which includes low period reduced symmetry orbits over a large range of Reynolds numbers. Chapter 5 will then summarize this thesis, and suggest potential topics for future research.
