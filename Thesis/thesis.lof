\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces Streamlines on two surfaces of differing smoothness showcase the difference between laminar and turbulent flows. (a) In turbulent flow across an extremely smooth surface, streamlines break up into chaotic eddies and swirls, while in (b), the laminar flow across a rough surface preserves the streamlines.

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces A schematic of the plane Couette geometry. The upper and lower plates (white) extend infinitely in the plane, as does the fluid (blue) filling the gap between. The upper and lower plates move with some constant velocity, and apply shear stresses on the fluid, resulting in fluid motion. While in general the plates can move in any direction, there is always a reference frame in which the plates move with equal but opposite velocity, and it is convenient to work in this reference frame. According to convention, the $x$ axis is aligned along the plate velocity, and is referred to as the {\bf streamwise} direction. The $y$-axis is aligned perpendicular to the plates and is referred to as the {\bf wall-normal} direction. The $z$-axis is normal to both axes and is referred to as the {\bf spanwise} direction.}}{2}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3}{\ignorespaces A cross-sectional representation of plane Couette flow, with the linear, laminar velocity profile shown. By symmetry, the laminar profile must be the same everywhere. At the top and bottom, where the fluid meets the walls, no-slip boundary conditions require that the wall-tangent velocity equal the boundary velocity.}}{3}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {7}{\ignorespaces The four main categories of exact coherent structures. In all diagrams, only a particular velocity structure of the flow state is displayed, to demonstrate the particular type of exact coherent structures. (a) An {equilibrium} solution, where the fluid structure does not change over time. (b) A {relative equilibirum} or {travelling wave} solution, where the state does not change in its own reference frame, but is translated relative to the observer. (c) A {periodic orbit}, where the flow state changes over time, but returns to the original state after some period $T$. (d) A {relative periodic orbit}, where the flow state is periodic in its own reference frame, but is translated relative to the observer.}}{7}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {8}{\ignorespaces A schematic of a 2D projection of a turbulent trajectory, and the coherent structures that guide it. (a) A turbulent trajectory in black appears chaotic and unpredictable in isolation. (b) When the underlying coherent structures in red are superimposed, however, the guiding of the dynamics by the exact coherent structures\ becomes evident. Starting from the left, the trajectory is pulled in towards an equilibrium (filled circle) along a stable manifold (arrow pointing inwards), before being ejected along an unstable manifold (arrow pointing outwards). The trajectory then shadows three periodic orbits, whose stable and unstable manifolds are not trivial to visually represent, but nonetheless exist, before being attracted and ejected by the final equilibrium, after which the trajectory may continue to remain turbulent, or may relaminarize.

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.3}{\ignorespaces A schematic of a 1D bifurcation, that shows the variation of a solution $x^*$ as a function of a control parameter $r$. While the control parameter $r < 2$, there is only one, stable solution, on the left. At a critical value $r = 2$, however, a new solution emerges at $x^* = 1$ in a {\bf saddle-node bifurcation}. When $2 < r < 4$, the saddle-node splits into two, producing a stable solution (solid) on the right, and an unstable solution (dashed) on the left. As $r$ approaches 4, the original stable solution and the new unstable solution approach each other until at $r=$, they annihilate in another saddle node bifurcation, leaving only the new stable solution.}}{33}
