\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces A schematic of the plane Couette geometry. The upper and lower plates (white) extend infinitely in the plane, as does the fluid (blue) filling the gap between. The upper and lower plates move with some constant velocity, and apply shear stresses on the fluid, resulting in fluid motion. While in general the plates can move in any direction, there is always a reference frame in which the plates move with equal but opposite velocity, and it is convenient to work in this reference frame. According to convention, the $x$ axis is aligned along the plate velocity and is referred to as the {\bf streamwise} direction. The $y$-axis is aligned perpendicular to the plates and is referred to as the {\bf wall-normal} direction. The $z$-axis is normal to both axes and is referred to as the {\bf spanwise} direction.}}{2}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {7}{\ignorespaces A schematic of a 2D projection of a turbulent trajectory, and the coherent structures that guide it. (a) A turbulent trajectory in black appears chaotic and unpredictable in isolation. (b) When the underlying coherent structures in red are superimposed, however, the guiding of the dynamics by the exact coherent structures\ becomes evident. Starting from the left, the trajectory is pulled in towards an equilibrium (filled circle) along a stable manifold (arrow pointing inwards), before being ejected along an unstable manifold (arrow pointing outwards). The trajectory then shadows three periodic orbits, whose stable and unstable manifolds are not trivial to visually represent, but nonetheless exist, before being attracted and ejected by the final equilibrium, after which the trajectory may continue to remain turbulent, or may relaminarize.

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.4}{\ignorespaces A flow chart that lays out the procedure used to find exact coherent structures. We begin by selecting a random initial state for the trajectory. This initial state can either be found by generating a truly random state, or by applying a small, random perturbation to a known exact coherent structures. The desired symmetry constraints are then enforced, and the trajectory is integrated from $t = 0$ to $t=t'$. After every time step, if the state's norm has dropped below some threshold $R$, we assume that the trajectory has relaminarized, and find a new initial condition to work with. Once the integration is over, we generate the recurrence diagram according to (3.47\hbox {}), for some $T_{\textrm {max}}$, and attempt to find any patterns we would associate with exact coherent structures. If no patterns are found, we find another initial state and repeat the process. If there are some candidate patterns, we calculate the minimum $\mathfrak {R}$ of that feature. If it is below some threshold, we accept it as a potential solution, and pass it to the NKH solver. If $\mathfrak {R}$ is not low enough, it is likely not a sufficiently good guess to cause the NKH solver to converge in a reasonable time, so we zoom in on the pattern and calculate a refined recurrence graph, until either the minimum value of the pattern is low enough, or it becomes apparent that the pattern is unlikely to produce a meaningful initial guess}}{36}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.5}{\ignorespaces A schematic of a 1D bifurcation, that shows the variation of a solution $x^*$ as a function of a control parameter $r$. While the control parameter $r < 2$, there is only one, stable solution, on the left. At a critical value $r = 2$, however, a new solution emerges at $x^* = 1$ in a {\bf saddle-node bifurcation}. When $2 < r < 4$, the saddle-node splits into two, producing a stable solution (solid) on the right, and an unstable solution (dashed) on the left. As $r$ approaches 4, the original stable solution and the new unstable solution approach each other until at $r=$, they annihilate in another saddle node bifurcation, leaving only the new stable solution. In higher dimensions, bifurcations can be incredibly complex, but we can nevertheless observe bifurcations of this form. }}{38}
