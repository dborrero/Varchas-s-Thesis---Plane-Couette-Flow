Dynamical systems in physics often display symmetry. The electron wavefunction in the ground state of hydrogen, or the gravitational motion of a planet around a star, for instance, display very high degrees of spatial symmetry.  Understanding the symmetries of a system can be incredibly useful to an investigator, since they hint at conserved physical quantities (through Noether's Theorem), and can greatly reduce the complexity of the system in various ways. But first, some definitions: \\

\begin{define}\cite{Rotman1995}
A {\bf group} $(G,\ast)$ is an object that contains a set $G$ and a binary operator known as the {\bf group law} $\ast: G \times G \to G$ that has the following properties 
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Closure}: For every $a,b\in G$, $a \ast b \in G$,
\item {\bf Associativity}: For every $a,b,c \in G$, $a \ast (b\ast c) = (a\ast b)\ast c$,
\item {\bf Identity}: There exists a the unique identity $e \in G$ such that for any $a \in G$, $e\ast a = a$,
\item {\bf Inverse}: For all $a\in G$, there exists an inverse $a^{-1} \in G$ such that $a \ast a^{-1}=a^{-1}\ast a = e$.
\end{enumerate}
and has a group action $\star: G\times A \to A$ on a set $A$ such that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Associativity} For all $a,b \in G$ and $\alpha \in A$, $a\star(b\star\alpha) =  (a \ast b)\star \alpha$,
\item {\bf Identity} For all $\alpha \in A$, $e \star \alpha = \alpha$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{define}
\begin{define}
The {\bf order} of a group $(G,\ast)$ is the number of elements in $G$. 
\end{define}
\begin{define}
A {\bf subgroup} $(H,\ast)$ of $(G,\ast)$ is a group such that $H \subseteq G$.  
\end{define}
\begin{define}\label{def:equivariance}
A {\bf symmetry group} for a dynamical system $\dot{\Vector{x}} = \Vector{f}(\Vector{x})$  is the group $(\Sigma,\ast)$ such that for any linear transformation $\sigma \in \Sigma$, 
\begin{equation}
\sigma\star \dot{\Vector{x}} = \sigma\star \Vector{f}(\Vector{x}) = \Vector{f}(\sigma \star \Vector{x}).
\end{equation}
Such a linear transformation is said to be a symmetry transformation, and the dynamical system is then said to be {\bf $\Sigma$-equivariant}.
\end{define}
\begin{define}
For a particular state $\Vector{u}$ in a dynamical system $\dot{\Vector{x}} = \Vector{f}(\Vector{x})$ , a symmetry group $(\Sigma,\ast)$ such that for all $\sigma \in \Sigma$,
\begin{equation}
\sigma \Vector{u}  = \Vector{u}
\end{equation}
is known as the {\bf isotropy subgroup} of $\Vector{u}$, and $\Vector{u}$ is said to {\bf satisfy} or be {\bf fixed} by $\Sigma$. 
\end{define}
\begin{define}
If a group $(G,\ast)$ has the further property that for all $a,b \in G$, $a \ast b = b \ast a$, then the group is {\bf abelian}
\end{define}
\begin{define}\label{def:conjugacy}
Two subgroups $(J,\ast)$ and $(H,\ast)$ of $(G,\ast)$ are considered {\bf conjugate} if for some $a \in G$,
\begin{equation}
a\ast J \ast a^{-1} = H.
\end{equation} 
A set of mutually conjugate groups makes up a {\bf conjugacy class}, and since the action of members of a conjugacy class on a particular state $\Vector{u}$ can be considered equivalent, only one representative member of a conjugacy class needs to be considered. 
\end{define}
\begin{define}
A set $\mathcal{G}$ is said to {\bf generate} a group $(G,\ast)$ if repeated applications of the group law between elements of $\mathcal{G}$ produced all the elements of $G$.
\end{define}
The symmetry relations of \pCf\ are discussed extensively in\rf{GIBSON2009,Halcrow2008}, which I will present here for the sake of flow\footnote{haha}. To keep things terse, the group action and group law operator is omitted and can be inferred from context, and a group $(G,\ast)$ is referred to by the set $G$. 
\section{Unbounded Navier-Stokes}

If we do not impose boundary conditions on the 3D Navier-Stokes equations on an infinite domain, the system will be equivariant under the group of continuous rotational and translational symmetry transformations, as well as the discrete {\bf pointwise inversion} symmetry transformation $\sigma_{xz}$\rf{Frisch1995}, which has the following action on the system:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:pointwiseinversion}
\sigma_{xz}\Vector{u}\paren{\Vector{x}} = -\Vector{u}\paren{-\Vector{x}}
\end{equation}

While the rotation or translation transformation can be easily conceptualized, the pointwise inversion transformation can provide some difficulty. The easiest way of visualizing the transformation is to view it in a 2D domain instead of in the full 3D, as shown in \figureref{fig:pointwiseinversion}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pointwiseinversion}
\caption{A 2D pointwise inversion operation on two sets of vectors according to \refeq{eq:pointwiseinversion}.}\label{fig:pointwiseinversion}

\end{figure}


\section{Plane Couette Flow}

If the domain is limited to $\mathbb{R}^2 \times [-1,1]$ with the boundary conditions of \pCf, we lose some of the symmetry transformations of the full, unrestricted problem, leaving us with two basic discrete symmetries: a rotation by $\pi$ about the $z$ axis (denoted $\sigma_x$) and a reflection about the $z$ axis (denoted $\sigma_z$)\footnote{The motivation for these subscripts will become apparent shortly}, together form a discrete symmetry group $D = D_1 \times D_1 = \{e, \sigma_x,\sigma_z,\sigma_{xz}\}$ of order 4, where

\begin{align}\label{eq:discretesymm}
\sigma_x [u,v,w](x,y,z) &= [-u,-v,w](-x,-y,z)\\
\sigma_z [u,v,w](x,y,z) &= [u,v,-w](x,y,-z)\\
\sigma_{xz} [u,v,w](x,y,z) &= [-u,-v,-w](-x,-y,-z)
\end{align}

The continuous symmetries are the two parameter steamwise-spanwise translations, which, when provided periodic boundary conditions, form a continuous $SO(2)\times SO(2)$ symmetry group 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:contsymm}
\tau(l_x,l_z)[u,v,w](x,y,z) = [u,v,w](x+l_x,y,z+l_z).
\end{equation}

The complete symmetry group is then any combination of these symmetry operations, given by $\Sigma = SO(2)_x \ltimes D_{1,x} \times SO(2)_z \ltimes D_{1,z}$\footnote{$\ltimes$ is the semidirect product}. 
\section{Properties and Isotropy Subgroups of $\Sigma$}

It should be evident that since \pCf\ is equivariant under the continuous translations given in \eqref{eq:contsymm}, trajectories can be traveling wave equilibria or relative periodic orbits: that is, if one moves into a different reference frame, the trajectory is a regular equilibrium or periodic orbit. However, an initial condition that is fixed by $\sigma_z$ cannot be translated in the spanwise direction without losing $\sigma_z$ symmetry (except for the trivial case where $\pder{1}{\Vector{u}_z}{z} = 0$). Similarly, an initial condition that is fixed by $\sigma_x$ cannot be translated in the streamwise direction without losing $\sigma_x$ symmetry (and an initial condition that is fixed by $\sigma_{xz}$ symmetry cannot be translated at all without losing $\sigma_{xz}$ symmetry). Since these symmetries are also invariant\footnote{That is, if the symmetry is satisfied at time $t = t_0$, it must be satisfied for all times. This is trivially true from \refDef{def:equivariance}}, a trajectory with one of the discrete symmetries cannot be a traveling wave in the direction corresponding to its subscript. \\
 \begin{figure}[t!]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{SubCell}
\caption{If the flow state is fixed by $\tau(\dfrac{1}{4}L_x,0)$, then the cell will have four repeating streamwise subcells, and it becomes more efficient to solely consider the subcell.}\label{fig:rationalTranslation}

\end{figure}
The presence of the periodic boundary conditions also implies that all solutions are fixed by the full-period translation $\tau(L_x,0)$ and $\tau(0,L_z)$. However, solutions can also be fixed by any rational translation of the form $\tau(a L_x,b L_z)$, where $a,b \in \mathbb{Q}$, or by the continuous translations. If we fix $\Vector{u}$ by a continuous translation, we force it to have a zero derivative along that axis\footnote{That is, if we fix $\Vector{u}$ by $\tau{l_x,0}$ for any real $l_x$, then $\pder{1}{\Vector{u}}{x} = 0$, and similarly for $z$.}, and such solutions tend to be uninteresting as they are equivalent to low-dimensional problems. If $\Vector{u}$ is fixed instead by rational translations, the periodic cell is tiled with repeating subcells , as in \refFig{fig:rationalTranslation}. This implies that we can restrict ourselves to full box length translations, which are in any case required by the periodic boundary conditions.\\

There is one further reason to restrict the translation symmetry - the unrestricted $\Sigma$ is not an abelian group, as demonstrated in \refFig{fig:notabelian}, so the order of application of symmetry transformations matters in general, which is undesirable, especially when trying to consider the conjugacy classes. From \refeqs{eq:discretesymm}{eq:contsymm} however, it is evident that the following relation between the $\sigma$ and $\tau$ holds:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{i}\tau_{i} = \tau_i^{-1}\sigma_i,
\end{equation}
where $i$ can index the $x$,$z$ or $xz$ symmetries. Left-multiplication by $\tau_i$ yields
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pscom}
\sigma_i\tau_i^2 = \tau_i^{-1}\sigma_i\tau_i.
\end{equation}
If $\tau_i$ is restricted to \emph{half}-box shifts, then \refeq{eq:pscom} becomes
\begin{equation}
\sigma_i\tau_{i,2}^2 = \sigma_i\tau_{i,1} = \sigma_i = \tau_{i,2}^{-1}\sigma_{i}\tau_{i,2},
\end{equation}
where the second subscript on $\tau$ represents the spatial periodicity imposed by $\tau$. Right multiplication by $\tau_{i,2}$ yields
\begin{equation}
\tau_{i,2}\sigma_{i} = \sigma_{i}\tau_{i,2}.
\end{equation}
So if $\tau$ is restricted to half-integer box shifts, $\Sigma_2 \subset \Sigma$ is an abelian group, as demonstrated in \refFig{fig:abelian}\footnote{Note that this also implies that $\tau_{i,2}$ is its own inverse.}. The subgroups of $\Sigma_2$, which form the isotropy subgroups for \pCf, are of order $\{1,2,4,8,16\}$. There is only one order 1 subgroup: $\{ e \}$, which is the typical isotropy group for turbulent flows\footnote{Since it lacks any symmetry.}. There are 15 subgroups of order 2, 35 subgroups of order 4, 15 subgroups of order 8, and one subgroup of order 16, giving 67 subgroups. Luckily, consideration of conjugacy classes greatly lowers the number of subgroups we need to consider. For instance, the subgroups $\{ e, \sigma_x\}$ and $\{e, \sigma_x\tau_{x,2}\}$ belong to the same conjugacy class.
\begin{proof}
Following \refDef{def:conjugacy}, choose $a = \tau_{x,4} \in \Sigma$. Then
\begin{equation}
\tau_{x,4}^{-1}\{ e, \sigma_x\}\tau_{x,4} = \{ \tau_{x,4}^{-1}\tau_{x,4},\tau_{x,4}^{-1}\sigma_x\tau_{x,4}\} =\{e,\tau_{x,4}^{-1}\sigma_x\tau_{x,4}\} .
\end{equation}
But by \refeq{eq:pscom},
\begin{equation}
\{ e,\tau_{x,4}^{-1}\sigma_x\tau_{x,4}\} = \{ e, \sigma_x\tau_{x,2}\}.
\end{equation}
So $\{ e, \sigma_x\}$ and $\{e, \sigma_x\tau_{x,2}\}$ belong to the same conjugacy class.
\end{proof}

So there are only eight conjugacy classes of order 2, with representatives generated by $\tau_x,\tau_z,\tau_{xz}, \sigma_x,\sigma_z,\sigma_{xz},\sigma_{x}\tau_z,\sigma_z\tau_x$. The conjugacy classes of pure translations can be disregarded, since they are equivalent to considering smaller cells, so we are left with five order 2 conjugacy classes. Of these, the two  generated by $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_x\tau_z$ do not permit streamwise traveling waves, the two generated by $\sigma_z$ and $\sigma_z\tau_x$ do not permit spanwise traveling waves, and one generated by  $\sigma_{xz}$ permits no traveling waves at all. Furthermore, groups of higher order go not have any conjugacy classes that permit symmetry breaking, so we will ignore those groups entirely, although a particular order 4 group, $S = \{ e, \sigma_z\tau_x,\sigma_x\tau_{xz},\sigma_{xz}\tau_z\}$, which has been the isotropy subgroup of many previous results\rf{GIBSON2009}, and is used as a starting point for some of the results for this thesis. The important \ecs\ of this thesis have isotropy subgroups $S_x = \{ e, \sigma_x\tau_{xz}\}$ and $S_z = \{e, \sigma_z\tau_{xz}\}$.
