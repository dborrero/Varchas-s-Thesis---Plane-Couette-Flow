To Do:
--------------------------------------------------
Daniel sends Varchas journal abbreviations file			Daniel 09/30/2014

Varchas benchmarks efficiency of the program			Varchas 10/07/2014

Varchas looks into running channelflow on multiple cores	Varchas 10/07/2014



Varchas does some general reading+lit review  				Varchas 10/07/2014

Varchas runs 'findsoln' on previously computed equilibria + some random variation  	Varchas 10/07/2014


Potential Solutions????
-------------------------------------------------

Varchas checks if MatLab is on the cluster+gets visualization working 	   		Varchas 10/07/2014
	- At least one computer in the ETC has MATLAB and is cooperating - just ran 
	  a findsoln of a known equilibrium and a perturbation away from it,
	  and visualized it. It looks good. The only problem is that I have to
	  manually move stuff over. You can take a look if you'd like, I'll 
	  put it under 'Results'
