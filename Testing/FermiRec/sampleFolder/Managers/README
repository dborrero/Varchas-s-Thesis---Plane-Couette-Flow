~~~Time Savers~~~
master.pl - Runs randGen, coueGen and recuGen. A useful way of firing and forgetting, once you know all the components work
zoomMaster.pl - Runs zoomCoueGen and zoomRecuGen.

~~~Heavy Lifters~~~
randGen - Reads Parameters/random.param to obtain all the necessary parameters to create a random initial field (hardcoded as 'random.ff')
coueGen - Reads Parameters/couette.param to obtain all the necessary parameters for running the time integration /except/ the output folder (hardcoded to 'data'), the L2 print flag, and the input field (hardcoded to 'random.ff')
recuGen - Reads Parameters/recurrence.param to obtain all the necessary parameters to generate the recurrence diagram /except/
